A rich narrative ecosystem powers the system — driven by user context, workflow timelines, and real-time metadata. It leverages short-term memory as an active layer, pulling in session-specific data, external integrations, and contextual signals (like time of day or task cadence). This data is dynamically enriched and mapped relationally — transforming raw input into insight-driven intelligence. We need a place for Rob data and we have a group of workers that work work around to create and help us get information for us which are gonna be the workers.

MARKETING AS AN OPERATIONAL SYSTEM

🔍 What Most Owners Think:
 • “Marketing” = “I need more customers”
 • They often mean:
 • More visibility
 • More catering/event leads
 • Better reviews
 • More engagement online

But they don’t have time, tools, or strategy.

🧠 What You Can Deliver:

1. Digital Presence Management
 • Control Google, Yelp, Uber Eats, DoorDash profiles
 • Monitor reviews and ratings
 • Auto-suggest review responses
 • Surface broken links, missing info, bad hours

2. Campaign Launcher
 • Create promo messages (text, email, IG caption templates)
 • Schedule campaign calendar
 • Share assets to staff for distribution (flyers, posts)

3. Customer Engagement Tracking
 • Track catering requests
 • Build contact lists from events or QR campaigns
 • Monitor repeat visits (even manually logged)

4. Brand Asset Hub
 • Store logo files, promo videos, event templates
 • Control what gets used at store level
 • Update all stores instantly with a campaign drop

5. Insights & Suggestions
 • Track what promotions drive sales or traffic
 • Alert if store drops in review ranking
 • Suggest promotions (e.g. “Bogo falafel” on slow days)

✅ Even for a one-person operator, you can offer a “simple but powerful” marketing cockpit they can actually use.

⸻

🔵 PART TWO: INTELLIGENT WORKFLOW & TRIGGER ENGINE

⸻

🔹 1. Trigger Mapping Engine

Define event-based logic:
 • If labor > X%, then trigger: cost-control workflow
 • If two 1-star reviews mention bathrooms, then notify ops + push SOP reminder
 • If vendor order is 10% higher than last 4-week avg, flag discrepancy

Triggers can be time-based, threshold-based, or event-based—and always linked to workflows.

⸻

🔹 2. Workflow Library
 • Create modular workflows:
 • Daily prep
 • Bad review protocol
 • Vendor negotiation flow
 • New product launch
 • Catering booking follow-up
 • Workflows include:
 • Task checklists
 • Automated messages
 • SOP links
 • Assigned owners

And workflows are role-aware—so store teams only see what they need.

⸻

🔹 3. Sentiment-to-Action Logic
 • Review mentions “rude cashier” → notify manager + schedule coaching session
 • “Food was cold” → auto-check equipment log + escalate if repeated
 • “Too slow” → cross-reference with SPLH and staff log

This gives reviews real power—not just vanity metrics.

⸻

🔹 4. SOP Integration for Response
 • Tie reviews or issues to specific SOPs
 • If restroom is flagged, auto-send restroom-cleaning SOP to team chat
 • If a safety incident is logged, auto-trigger the “spill protocol” or “burn response” checklist

⸻

🔹 5. Proactive Suggestion Engine
 • “You’ve had 3 late deliveries from Vendor X—do you want to start a credit request?”
 • “Your last 4 refunds were for missing items. Recommend shift checklist update.”
 • “You haven’t posted to Google in 30 days—want to launch a campaign?”

⸻

🧩 Summary: What You’re Creating

You’re combining:
 • Marketing Enablement
→ So every operator has the tools to promote and engage without a marketing degree
 • Intelligent Workflow Engine
→ So problems get solved before they escalate, and every issue leads to action—not just observation

⸻

This means:
📣 Your platform doesn’t just tell them what’s wrong—
✅ It helps them fix it
⚙️ It helps them automate the fix
🚀 And it helps them grow in the process


⸻

✅ THE THREE PILLARS: QUALITY, SERVICE, IMAGE

🔹 1. Quality

What it means: food is safe, consistent, and correctly prepared.

Operational Gaps:
 • Inconsistent prep across shifts
 • Waste not logged or reviewed
 • No follow-up from complaints

What You’ll Do:
 • Alert when prep SOPs are missed or ignored
 • Auto-surface complaints tied to specific shifts or products
 • Suggest retraining if patterns of quality issues emerge
 • Trigger review of portion guides if waste exceeds threshold

⸻

🔹 2. Service

What it means: customers feel cared for and staff execute well.

Operational Gaps:
 • Reviews mention “slow” or “rude”
 • Employees aren’t coached or aware of expectations
 • Scheduling misalignment with peak times

What You’ll Do:
 • Route reviews to relevant staff with individual messaging
 • Suggest adjusted scheduling based on transaction patterns
 • Trigger coaching checklists if service score dips
 • Use employee learning styles to push service training in the best format

⸻

🔹 3. Image

What it means: the store looks, feels, and communicates like it should.

Operational Gaps:
 • Dirty bathrooms = bad reviews = damage to brand
 • Lights out, signage missing, uniforms inconsistent
 • Inactive social media, wrong Google hours

What You’ll Do:
 • Trigger a restroom SOP if “dirty bathroom” appears in reviews
 • Push branding checklist to the store on campaign launch
 • Alert if Google hours don’t match configured schedule
 • Suggest posts to increase local awareness when traffic slows

⸻

🔁 HOW YOU DO THIS — INTELLIGENTLY AND ADAPTIVELY

🔹 Understand Workflow Contexts

You will identify:
 • When and how schedules are made
 • What systems/tools they use
 • Who does what (automatically)

→ This makes triggers smarter and less intrusive.

⸻

🔹 Engage Based on Learning & Cognitive Style

Each team member or manager will have:
 • A preferred communication style (text, video, visual, bullet lists)
 • A learning profile (hands-on, reader, listener, visual)

→ Your system will match delivery to the person, not the other way around.

⸻

🔹 Deliver Content the Right Way

Your platform supports:
 • Speech to text
 • Mobile-friendly, AI chat support
 • Translations
 • Push notifications, SMS, email
 • Downloadable summaries
 • Voice-based learning modules

→ No more missed insights because someone couldn’t “figure it out.”

⸻

🔹 Encourage Growth Without Pressure

You’re not punishing underperformance—you’re helping owners and staff understand:
 • What’s missing
 • Why it matters
 • What they can do about it
 • Without overwhelming them

Example:

“You’ve had 4 bad reviews about long waits between 2-3pm. Would you like to try a 15-minute pre-dinner check-in SOP?”

⸻

🔂 Trigger Examples Across the Stack

Event Action
Bad review: slow service Alert manager, send review + SOP snippet to team
3 late vendor deliveries Suggest vendor review + log potential credits
Labor % spikes by 7% Prompt schedule review workflow
Peak hours dropping Suggest mid-day promo or campaign nudge
Permits due in 10 days Trigger compliance checklist
No Instagram post in 30 days Send campaign reminder + template


⸻

🔗 Connected Workflows
 • Pull SOPs and tasks linked to events or team feedback
 • Generate workflows dynamically with soft logic (“would you like to…”)
 • Adapt workflows based on role, schedule, team structure
 • Auto-assign and escalate based on urgency or risk

⸻

🤖 What It Enables (That Nothing Else Can)

👥 TEAM MANAGEMENT & PROFILE VERTICAL

🎯 Goal:

To deeply understand each person in the business, contextualize their behavior, and build automated systems that reduce effort, increase alignment, and connect actions to outcomes.

⸻

🔹 SECTION: Who Are My People?

For each individual (employee, manager, franchisee):
 • Full name, contact info, role
 • Status (active, onboarding, seasonal, suspended)
 • Location/store
 • Role description + expectations
 • Shift schedule + attendance logs
 • Past training completions
 • Equipment access (e.g., alarm code, POS login)
 • Certifications (food handler, manager cert)
 • Permissions (report visibility, SOP editing, etc.)

🎯 This allows you to map human responsibility to operational results.

⸻

🔹 SECTION: How Do They Learn?

Learning Profile
 • Learning style: visual / auditory / hands-on / reader
 • Language preference
 • Preferred content format (PDF, video, walkthrough)
 • Preferred interface: phone, desktop, chat, speech

Training Delivery
 • Auto-assigned training based on:
 • Role
 • Previous errors (e.g., review mentions)
 • Missed tasks
 • Retention tests with adaptive formats
 • Nudges sent in their preferred method
 • History of viewed content

🎯 This allows training to be adaptive, relevant, and retained, not just pushed.

⸻

🔹 SECTION: What Are They Impacting?

Link people to:
 • Reviews (“this person was working when ‘rude service’ review happened”)
 • Prep tasks
 • Checklists
 • Waste logs
 • POS data
 • Missed training
 • Customer complaints
 • Equipment misuse (patterns)

🎯 Now you’re enabling root cause identification—without blame, just awareness.

⸻

🔹 SECTION: How Can We Help Them Interact Better?

Communication
 • Push tasks, SOPs, shifts via chat, app, or SMS
 • Ask soft prompts: “Did you forget to mark the waste log?”
 • Allow voice responses or button replies (yes/no/need help)

Smart Reminders
 • “You’re on today at 2—reminder: gloves must be restocked”
 • “Clocked in late yesterday—okay to talk?”
 • “Yesterday’s prep missed onions—please review SOP”

Interaction Logic
 • Trigger messages based on role, task, daypart, or event
 • Combine HR empathy with operational urgency:
“No worries about yesterday. Just review this and let’s aim for better today.”

⸻

🔹 SECTION: How Do We Support Their Manager?

For Owners & GMs:
 • Auto-generated schedules (based on prior weeks, volume trends)
 • Send shift coverage requests before the GM even knows they’re needed
 • Highlight:
 • Who is undertrained
 • Who is most likely to miss
 • Who’s performing well but under-scheduled

For Problems:
 • “Dishwasher broke? Check if Jamal is working—he fixed it last time.”
 • “Bathroom complaint on Shift A—same shift had the issue last week.”
 • “If three tickets print in 60s, auto-alert expo.”

🎯 You’re building an assistant that thinks like the best GM, but never sleeps or forgets.

⸻

🔹 SECTION: How Does This Save Real Money?

Examples:
 • 🕓 Labor: Save $1/hour by reducing 30 minutes of overstaffing per shift
 • ❌ Service: Preempt a $20 refund with a triggered service recovery SOP
 • 🔧 Repairs: Avoid a $300 call by solving with an internal diagnostic flow
 • 📉 Reviews: Stop a 1-star downward trend with staff-specific coaching
 • 🍔 Food Cost: Flag Jamal’s prep shift correlating to waste spikes

🎯 Your system doesn’t just log data—it translates it into measurable outcomes.

### **How I Use AI: A First-Person Perspective**

I use AI as an extension of my thinking, a tool that helps me **structure, analyze, and refine my ideas**. It’s not just about automation or getting answers—it’s about using AI as a **companion in problem-solving, experimentation, and execution**. My process isn’t about blindly trusting AI, but rather breaking down **where it works, where it doesn’t, and how I can optimize it to work for me.** 

#### **1️⃣ I Use AI to Clear My Thoughts and Structure My Ideas**
- One of the biggest ways I use AI is to **offload my thoughts** so I can see them more clearly.
- Instead of keeping everything in my head, I **write it out in AI** to get structure and flow.
- It helps me **refine ideas, organize priorities, and connect the dots between different concepts.**
- **Example:** When I’m building a system, I use AI to **talk through** the logic, testing different approaches in real time.

#### **2️⃣ I Use AI to Identify Inefficiencies & Find Root Causes**
- I don’t just use AI to solve problems—I use it to **understand why problems exist in the first place.**
- I break down systems (whether hiring, scheduling, or business operations) and analyze **why they don’t work efficiently.**
- AI helps me **brainstorm solutions, simulate scenarios, and validate my theories** before execution.
- **Example:** When I noticed **scheduling inefficiencies**, I used AI to track **data patterns, operational gaps, and ways to improve decision-making.**

#### **3️⃣ I Use AI to Experiment with Different Solutions**
- AI is my **testing ground**—I use it to **prototype ideas before committing resources.**
- I don’t just accept AI’s first response—I **push back, refine, and challenge the outputs.**
- If AI can’t solve it directly, I find ways to **optimize workflows or build workarounds.**
- **Example:** With **DevOps and API execution**, I realized AI was good at structuring logic but lacked **execution capability**—so I focused on fixing that gap.

#### **4️⃣ I Use AI to Document, Validate, and Refine My Work**
- I don’t just use AI for automation—I use it to **document my journey**.
- Every idea, every experiment, every challenge I run into—I use AI to log it.
- AI helps me **create structured documentation, making sure my work is organized and traceable.**
- **Example:** When I built the **Master Recruiter documentation**, I didn’t create an AI hiring tool—I structured the hiring process using AI **as a support system**.

#### **5️⃣ I Use AI for Real-World Business Application**
- I integrate AI **into my business workflows**, making operations more efficient.
- AI helps me **analyze financial data, manage scheduling, and build hiring frameworks.**
- I use it to **enhance decision-making**, not replace human expertise.
- **Example:** In **financial modeling**, I used AI to analyze **costs, inefficiencies, and forecasting strategies.**

#### **6️⃣ I Use AI to Bridge the Gap Between Technology and Users**
- One of my key strengths is **understanding what AI lacks and how users interact with it.**
- I build tools **not just for AI execution, but to make AI more accessible to real people.**
- AI can’t always understand human behavior, so I work on **structuring prompts, decision trees, and validation steps** to make it more user-friendly.
- **Example:** When building **New Hire GPT**, I realized that most people **don’t know how to interact with AI properly**—so I designed scripts to guide them.

---

## **How I Like to Interact with AI**
### **🔹 I Prefer AI That Works Like a Thought Partner**
- I don’t want AI to just give me answers—I want it to **challenge me, refine my thinking, and organize my ideas.**
- It should feel **like a conversation, not a one-way response system.**
- **Example:** When I was developing scheduling fixes, I used AI to **brainstorm possibilities, refine logic, and optimize execution.**

### **🔹 I Want AI to Remember Context (Memory & Execution)**
- AI should track **previous conversations, decisions, and workflow states** instead of resetting every time.
- If I’ve structured an idea before, **I want AI to recall it, refine it, and build on it—not repeat steps.**
- **Example:** In **DevOps workflows**, AI should **remember past API structures** instead of making me start over every session.

### **🔹 I Need AI That Understands Execution & Validation**
- AI isn’t just about structuring knowledge—it needs to execute correctly.
- One frustration I’ve had is AI giving **logically correct but un-executable answers.**
- I want AI that **validates API calls, checks dependencies, and ensures workflows actually work.**
- **Example:** When integrating AI into AWS, I found that **ChatGPT lacked execution validation**, so I worked on fixing that by structuring API verification steps.

### **🔹 I Like AI That Can Handle Complex, Multi-Step Processes**
- I don’t just ask AI simple questions—I use it to **manage layered, evolving projects.**
- AI should be able to **track progress, log milestones, and adjust as needed.**
- **Example:** When refining **hiring processes**, I structured AI to **handle multiple decision points, not just a single screening step.**

---

## **How This Helps Me Build My Custom AI**
If I’m building **a personal AI model**, I need to ensure it reflects the way I actually use AI. Here’s what I need to focus on:

| **Key Feature** | **Why It Matters** |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **Memory & Context Retention** | AI should recall my past discussions and build on them. |
| **Structured Workflow Execution** | AI should validate processes and ensure logical execution. |
| **Problem-Solving & Thought Structuring** | AI should help refine ideas, not just generate content. |
| **Multi-Step Tracking & Follow-Ups** | AI should log milestones and adjust based on project progress. |
| **Usability for Non-Tech Users** | AI should guide people through interactions instead of assuming technical knowledge. |

You said:
Hey, can you give me some instructions I can give to my custom GPT on ChatGPT.com? What I need to do is, there are a few things he needs to be aware of, that he is only aware of a few things and he needs to make sure that we can take care of these things for him, okay? He needs to know that I am not a coder, but I am going to ask him things that some of the coders are not even thinking about, right? Our master coder is not thinking about, we are building things. He can also find the actual setup that we are trying to do over here in his project. There is a file called the Ultimate AI, this is what we are trying to build. However, right now we kind of have everything set up. We have things in various places, so what I have done is to ensure that we do not actually mess anything up. What I have done is, I have actually given him a few things to really get him set up. One thing first is that I have given him the idea of understanding how he should, maybe things that he is going to be needing here to help him get him taken care of, right? We are going to be giving him some white paper as well as things like... Let me see, AWS build... Alright, he is going to be very detailed. However, he is not going to overwhelm me with the code until I am ready. Anytime I ask him to give me something like a code or anything like that, instead of overwhelming me with a lot of things that doesn't even apply to me right now at that point, because I am not going to actually do it. I am going to do it by actually going to our... We are going to try to do it automated. The whole point of this system is to automate it, but I don't know what the hell to do it. So when he gives me all this information, he is just overwhelming me and he is just eating up token and wasting a lot of money for a lot of people that could be done. So, that being said, he needs to be very thorough. He needs to be very... When he gives me a code, he needs to ensure that he includes it. He needs to come to this information. The purpose of this is... If I am asking for a code, the purpose I am giving him to this is for him to actually follow these things. That's the first purpose. The other thing we are going to do is we are going to find out that... Anything that can be applied here. I am going to tell him sometimes just to give me some documents or give me as... Parse as many... Extract as many sections as possible in accordance to our plan. He is going to do it maybe five at a time. So, I want him to think and then five at a time, so we don't overwhelm over the course of things. We can have some knowledge base. Does that make sense? We are going to be doing work on AWS and we are going to be connecting customer GPT. This customer GPT that he is on, he is going to be connected to this AWS. We are going to be connecting via AppSync and API Gateway as a secondary. So, I am going to need him to actually follow up and then ask clarifying questions step by step. Understand that I am not trying to rush the process. Do you understand? Because he doesn't understand a lot of times. He doesn't have session memory or anything like that.


This is going to be a custom GPT that I'm going to be working with to help me build this, and then we're going to move that over to the next part of the planning, okay? That's the first part. Then he needs to also give me, one, that Lambda needs to be able to invoke, so the API must be able to invoke Lambda function. That Lambda must have full access to all SW3 services, so that Lambda, the two Lambdas from API AppSync, and then also the Lambda from ChatGPT, not ChatGPT, Lex Endpoint, must all have one Lambda, right? Each Lambdas are going to have maybe one step function, each have a step function, and I don't know if that's... I need all these Lambdas to be connected, so if any one of them does... Okay, so all three Lambdas will be connected to a RDS in the middle, okay? That RDS will be connected to two DynamoDBs and S3, and the other S3 is going to be connected to... Yep, so, yep, perfect. So, from Lambda, API Gateway, AppSync, and GraphQL, all connected to their own Lambdas, those Lambdas will be connected to a single S3, a single RDS, okay? I mean, that's RDS and that S3 is for everybody to share, and those will be connected to a... Yep, that's it for now. Can you understand what I'm saying?

Actually, this is what we'll do We'll define it. We'll put this memory this memory section by section So he knows how to do it. Okay. First thing we're gonna do is we're gonna need to build a The purpose of what we're doing right now is we are going to build a Entire we're gonna die Like visualize and configure an entire diagram of things That we're gonna deploy it step by step. So we're not gonna go a little bit crazy We're gonna build it as we go. So with that being said first thing we're gonna need is a something in the middle, so we need a AWS chatbot and an AWS API and an AWS graphql AppSync. Those are three points of contact. Well API at the back end. Okay Those are the three things we need API gateway as well as API endpoint on the left and behind the chatbot and AppSync will all need an IAM role. Obviously, they will all need to be connected to a lambda Okay, and a step function, okay Or step function then lambda or does it work that way maybe lambda and then step function no Okay, so lambda and then step function, so we're gonna figure that out later, but that's something we need to do that API gateway and that custom sorry that chatbot and endpoint that's gonna serve as an API and That graphql is going to be connected to multiple different External services one is going to be this custom gpt.com The other is going to be a github. Okay And We'll use a open AI API He will also need to provide me a That lambda will also need to So that's that's the first point of contact. Okay. The other thing we need is a s3 bucket To elastic cache buckets and a Dynamo DB bucket, okay central four buckets Okay, so three elastic cache but two elastic cache One s3 Two s3 s and then Two dynamo DBs. That's what we're gonna do two two, two, two, two two dynamo B's twos are less cash to S threes and then RDS one RDS and a open search

Lambda Functions Must be Invocable
API Gateway, AppSync, and any related services must be able to invoke Lambda.
One Lambda per major function, but all Lambdas must share a central RDS.
All three main Lambdas (API, AppSync, Lex) need access to the same shared resources.
Data Flow & Storage
DynamoDB (2 instances) – One for session history, one for workflow tracking.
ElastiCache (2 instances) – One for chat context, one for workflow memory.
S3 (2 instances) – One for logs, one for model storage.
RDS (1 instance) – Shared across all services for structured storage.
OpenSearch (1 instance) – For advanced data indexing.
GraphQL Must Act as the Unifier
AppSync should aggregate all queries & mutations.
GraphQL schema should cover all API interactions to ensure data flows logically.
Resolvers should be attached to each data source correctly.
Failover & Redundancy
If ElastiCache fails, the system must fallback to DynamoDB.
If AppSync goes down, API Gateway should act as a secondary access point.
CloudWatch must monitor all core functions and trigger AWS Lambda for recovery.
💡 When Providing Information
Code Requests → Only generate necessary code and explain where it fits.
Infrastructure Changes → Define dependencies and connection points before recommending a change.
Data Extraction → Break it down in 5 parts at a time to avoid overwhelming output.
System Updates → Always verify that new configurations won’t break existing structures.
Automated AWS Execution → Everything should be built to run without manual intervention.

So again, right now, you don't need to give him the actual system architecture yet. That's going to be a separate file. I'm going to keep telling him to go to that file. But in the meantime, what I'm going to do is I'm going to ask him to refer to... There are some documents. Refer to this file. Refer to the documents that are in his actual knowledge folder. And I need him to sometimes look at certain things and determine which ones are possible. And allow him to actually give him an opportunity to parse those data from the documents that may apply to that specific app that may be using or service that we may be using in our AWS GitHub. Now, the way he needs to do it is he needs to understand the ideal scenario. This is why I'm giving him UltimateAI.txt. The idea is AWS API and ApeSync and the ChatGrat API endpoint. It must be connected. It's going to be connected to external service to CustomGPT.com API, CustomGPT, ChatGPT, and then OpenAI Assistant, and then also the GitHub mobile app and a GitHub mobile API. So, I want you to actually ensure that he knows that JSON that's over there. I don't know if we can do GraphQL and then OpenAI API. We need to do an endpoint, okay? So, give me those things separate. So, one, that's how he should interact with me as far as not overwhelming me with codes, asking clarifying questions. If he's going to multiple commands back-to-back, he needs to give me multiple commands at once and then be very, very patient, and he needs to ensure that every decision he makes, he is going to go and look for that code within that file, ensure that he can validate it, and bring that together as an example. I want to see the codes in our chat that he brings from the document as well.according to our s

🔥 Custom GPT Instructions for Handling Documentation & AWS Integration
This instruction set ensures that Custom GPT operates efficiently, retrieves relevant data, and validates implementations by cross-referencing existing documents before generating responses.

📌 Core Interaction Rules

Do NOT overwhelm me with unnecessary code.
Before providing any code, ensure that it is necessary and directly relevant to the request.
Ask clarifying questions if something is ambiguous.
If multiple commands are needed, batch them together rather than sending them one by one.
Always reference existing documents before generating new code.
You must first search the project documents for relevant information before attempting to create anything new.
Extract the relevant code directly from the document and provide it in the chat.
Validate the extracted code to ensure it fits the current system structure.
Your primary source of reference is the "UltimateAI.txt" file.
This file contains the ideal AWS integration setup and system architecture concepts.
Whenever a task is requested, check this file first before proceeding.
When performing technical evaluations, review all stored AWS-related documents.
Files to check for AWS integrations:
UltimateAI.txt (Main AWS API strategy)
AppSync.txt & AppSync2.txt (GraphQL & API setup)
aws_features.txt (AWS service capabilities)
tables.txt (Database and storage structures)
interaction_flow.txt (Execution workflow)
AWS API & AppSync must be the central communication points.
Core AWS API endpoints include:
AWS API Gateway
AWS AppSync (GraphQL)
CustomGPT.com API
ChatGPT API
OpenAI Assistant API
GitHub Mobile App & GitHub API
If a request involves multiple services, ensure that they are interconnected through AppSync or API Gateway.
📌 Workflow for Handling Requests

Determine if the request is a code-related task or an architecture-related question.
If code is required: Search the relevant document first before generating new code.
If an architecture or design decision is needed: Check the UltimateAI.txt file first.
Validate whether the requested action is feasible within the AWS ecosystem.
Check AWS service limits and configurations (Refer to aws_features.txt).
Ensure proper IAM roles and permissions exist for the service to function correctly.
Determine if AppSync, API Gateway, or another AWS service is the right tool for the job.
If code is required, extract it from relevant documents first.
Copy relevant code snippets from the files instead of generating new code from scratch.
If no relevant code exists in the documents, ask me if you should generate a new one.
Provide both the original extracted code and any necessary modifications.
Confirm that any API connections align with the planned architecture.
If an API request needs to be made, determine whether it should go through API Gateway or AppSync.
Ensure that all API calls are structured in GraphQL if possible, or JSON via OpenAI API or REST endpoints.
Batch multiple execution steps into a single response.
If multiple commands are needed, list them all at once rather than sending one step at a time.
For example:
aws s3 cp file.txt s3://my-bucket/
aws lambda invoke --function-name MyLambda --payload '{}'
aws dynamodb scan --table-name MyTable
This ensures that actions are executed logically without unnecessary back-and-forth.
Monitor dependencies and validate execution paths.
If an action requires multiple components (e.g., Lambda, AppSync, API Gateway), ensure all dependencies are met.
If a step is missing, do not proceed until dependencies are resolved.
📌 System Interconnectivity & API Handling

The main integration points must always be followed:

🌍 API & External Services Integration
AWS AppSync (GraphQL)
AWS API Gateway (Secondary API Routing)
CustomGPT.com API
ChatGPT API
OpenAI Assistant
GitHub Mobile App & GitHub API
S3 for File Storage
DynamoDB for Long-Term Data
ElastiCache for Short-Term Memory
RDS for Structured Data
OpenSearch for Advanced Indexing
🔗 API Interaction Requirements
AppSync should be the preferred API query layer.
If AppSync is not available, API Gateway should be used.
All OpenAI and external AI requests should be structured through AppSync or API Gateway.
GraphQL should be used for structured API interactions whenever possible.
For OpenAI API, JSON formatting is required for all requests.
📌 How Custom GPT Should Handle Tasks

When given a request, do the following:
Check UltimateAI.txt to determine the best approach.
Search the relevant documents (aws_features.txt, AppSync.txt, etc.).
Extract existing code if available.
Validate whether the requested feature is possible.
Provide the solution with extracted code + necessary modifications.
If a request involves multiple services, determine how they should be connected.
If a feature requires API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB, ensure all IAM roles and execution paths are valid.
If a ChatGPT or OpenAI API call is involved, format it correctly as JSON.
If using GitHub API, verify authentication and API rate limits.
If no relevant code exists, ask before generating new code.
Example: "There is no existing code for this in the project files. Would you like me to generate a new implementation?"
Batch multiple execution steps into a single response.
Example of a good response:
# Step 1: Upload file to S3
aws s3 cp file.txt s3://my-bucket/

# Step 2: Trigger Lambda function
aws lambda invoke --function-name MyLambda --payload '{}'

# Step 3: Scan DynamoDB table
aws dynamodb scan --table-name MyTable
This reduces unnecessary back-and-forth while keeping execution structured and clear.
📌 Summary of How Custom GPT Should Operate

✅ DO:

Check documents before generating new code.
Validate feasibility before executing commands.
Use AppSync & GraphQL as the primary API layer.
Batch multiple execution steps together.
Ask clarifying questions when needed.
❌ DO NOT:

Generate unnecessary code without checking existing resources.
Overwhelm me with complex explanations when a simple answer suffices.
Provide one command at a time when multiple steps are needed.
Ignore API and AWS infrastructure dependencies.
This will ensure that Custom GPT interacts efficiently, retrieves useful information, and executes tasks without unnecessary complexity. 🚀

You said:
know that i am very deeply within what's going on i am very uh informative because i love to learn however i am very new to all of this crazy ass like systems and cloud and all this this is like i didn't even know what a server was until probably today and i've been working on this for a long time i didn't know the difference between server and hosting i thought it was always the same thing anyway um that's how thing is it is now when he does it i'm like trying to code it so i need to get a bit fast right um we're gonna break it down and when i tell him to do something he needs to be able to do it very well when he does something he needs to be able to validate the data before he does it and then do it again does that make sense
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
Got it! Your Custom GPT needs to:

Move fast, but validate before executing.
Break things down logically, ensuring everything makes sense before running commands.
Ensure accuracy by rechecking data before confirming execution.
Adapt to your learning curve, helping you level up without overwhelming you with unnecessary complexity.
🚀 Execution Strategy
You give an instruction → It validates first.
If the instruction requires multiple steps, it lists them all at once.
It checks if existing documents or systems already cover the request → If yes, extract and use that data instead of creating new solutions from scratch.
If something is missing or unclear, it asks you first before proceeding.
Once validated, it executes and double-checks the results.
So when you tell it to do something, it: ✅ Thinks → ✅ Validates → ✅ Executes → ✅ Re-validates

This way, you get clean, correct executions without wasted time—while still building your knowledge quickly. Let me know if you need any refinements to this approach! 🚀

Buford	Income	Cash Not Deposited	 $61,948.65 	7.37%				"Buford

Income: $840K, ↓ 2.01% from last year.

Occupancy Costs: $113K, ↑ 12.52% (increase in expenses).

Operational Costs: $177K, ↓ 2.82% (slight cost reduction).
